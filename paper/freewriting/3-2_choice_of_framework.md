# Choice of Framework

## Outline

- Which frameworks were chosen to test?
- Why were these frameworks chosen?
- Which frameworks/tools were considered

## Content

Requirements for the choice of framework were solely that the designed application was implementable within the framework without the use of any other non-native tool to the framework and that the framework should be implementable in JavaScript. The ease of use or developer experience should explicitly not influence the choice because it would be part of the evaluation of the frameworks.

The choice of framework for this study should be based on usage and awareness of tools. A study of tools that nobody uses is worthless. The [state of JavaScript 2023](https://2023.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/) reveals the most-used JavaScript front-end framework. The top four most-used frameworks were chosen: Svelte (25%), Angular (45%), Vue.js (50%) and React (84%). Additionally, Astro was chosen for its especially high awareness under the category "other front-end tools" (30%) and its usage (19%) and interest (62%) in the category "meta-frameworks". From the same category, two other frameworks were chosen: Next.js and Nuxt. Addiationally, those frameworks were chosen for their appearance of making React and Vue.js better, respectively.

All chosen frameworks fulfil the requirements for this study. Solid and Qwik were also considered for the list of frameworks in this study because of their high interest among developers and potential for high performance.Additionally, from the list of most used front-end frameworks Preact was considered with a usage percentage of 13%. Ultimately, all three were not chosen because of negative sentiment or low usage among developers.
