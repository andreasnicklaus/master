  abstractNote={It is a critical requirement for the future of 5G communication networks to provide high speed and significantly reduce network energy consumption. In the Fifth Generation (5G), wireless cellular networks, smartphone battery efficiency, and optimal utilization of power have become a matter of utmost importance. Energy-efficient networks along with an energy-saving strategy in mobile devices play a vital role in the mobile revolution. The goal of energy efficiency, apart from its ecological value, is also associated with the reduction of operational expenses for mobile network operators, as well as with greater customer satisfaction thanks to increased battery life. Battery and power are an area of significant challenges considering that smartphones are nowadays equipped with advanced technological network features and interfaces. These features require a lot of simultaneous power to make decisions and to transfer information between devices and networks to provide the best user experience. Furthermore, to meet the demands of increased data capacity, data rate, and to provide the best quality of service, there is a need to adopt energy-efficient architectures. The new strategies should not only focus on wireless base stations, which consumes most of the power, but it should also take into consideration the other power consumption elements for future mobile communication networks, including User Equipment (UE). In this paper, we do an overview of power consumption and improvements made so far on the networks and user equipment side and provide our proposals on how to overcome these power- European Scientific Journal, ESJ ISSN: 1857-7881 (Print) e - ISSN 1857-7431 January 2021 edition Vol.17, No.3 www.eujournal.org 316 hungry issues on the newly 5G systems.},
